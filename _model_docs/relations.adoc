[[docrelations]]
== Document relations

=== General

* Source: ISO 690, 4.3
* Serialisation: `bibitem/relation`

The model allows for various relations between bibliographic items,
with one related item embedded within the other.

=== Relation types

`bibitem/relation/@type` gives the base class of the relation
between two bibliographic items.

The base class of relation types is taken from ISO 690 and
https://www.ifla.org/publications/functional-requirements-for-bibliographic-records[Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records] (FRBR),
and represents generic bibliographical requirements, particularly
inclusion in a host item (<<host-item>>: `includedIn`, `includes`)
and translation (<<translation>>: `translatedFrom`, `hasTranslation`).
The class has been expanded substantially to deal with the
requirements of standards documents.

In addition, the class has also been designed for extensibility:
refinements to the base class can be expressed through
`bibitem/relation/description`, with the understanding that the
relation described in that element is a subset of the relation
named in `bibitem/relation/@type`.
Relations can be modelled in a hierarchical fashion, and we attempt
to do so in the following; but relations are kept in `@type`, rather
than moved to `description`, if they are commonplace.

The modelling of relation types draws on the four basic classes of
bibliographic entity modelled in FRBR:

* Work: a distinct intellectual or artistic creation

* Expression: a realisation of a Work (e.g. edition, adaptation)

* Manifestation: the physical embodiment of an Expression (e.g.
print run; audio vs online vs print)

* Item: a single exemplar of a Manifestation

All relations in the following are given with their inverse in
italics and brackets, unless the relation is symmetric.

==== Part-Whole relations

includes:: document A includes document B, through a well-defined
relation outlined in <<host-item>>, and with distinct metadata
(including authorship) and bibliographic record (e.g. Chapter in
Edited Work, Illustration in Book).
In general, text-based resources have components that can be considered a 
different kind of resource (`includes`); components of non-textual resources are considered
to be of the same type as their host (`hasPart`). (_includedIn_)

hasPart:: document A includes document B, with no distinct metadata
(other than extent) or bibliographic record, and all items in
document B share the same authorship or corporate authorship (e.g.
Chapter, Section, Part, Volume, Issue, Track) (_partOf_)

merges:: document A results from a merger of earlier documents B1,
B2, B3... (_mergedInto_)

splits:: document A1, A2, A3... is split off from earlier documents
B (_splitInto_)

==== FRBR Level relations

In the following, document A is typically an Expression, since
expressions are typically what get their own bibliographic entry in
catalogues and databases.

Relations in the following are subclassed: this is indicated by
indentation.

instanceOf:: document B is an instance of document A (e.g. an
edition, a format, a single copy: agnostic as to whether B is an
Expression, Manifestation, or Item). (_hasInstance_)
+
--
Instances are often used in the Relaton modelling of standards, since
concrete documents (FRBR Expressions) are often lumped together
as more abstract entities (typically FRBR Works), particularly for
the purposes of citation. This is a cover-all for the more specific
relations `exemplarOf`, `manifestationOf`, and `expressionOf`.

So different
editions of a standard are often lumped together as a single Work;
the different editions of a standard are then modelled as instances of
the undated standard. Similarly, translations of a standard are often
lumped together as a single Work; the distinct language versions are
then modelled as instances of the same, language-independent standard.
--

exemplarOf:: document B is an Item of document A: document B is a
single physical instance of the bibliographic item,
which is more generically referred to as document A. (_hasExemplar_)


manifestationOf:: document B is a Manifestation of document A:
document B  an embodiment in a particular medium of the content of a bibliographic item.
which is more generically referred to as document A. Includes the more
specific relations `reproductionOf` and `reprintOf`. (_hasManifestation_)

reproductionOf::: document B is a Manifestation of the same
Expression as document A (reproduction): document B presents the same content as document A, and document B
has been created to reproduce document A faithfully. 
Includes the more specific relation `reprintOf`. (_hasReproduction_)

reprintOf:::: document B is a reproduction of document A, involving
a new publisher or distributor and mass dissemination, and no
overriding concern with reproducing the source manifestation
precisely (not necessarily restricted to print media) (_hasReprint_)

expressionOf:: document B is an Expression of document A: document B
is a particular realisation of the intellectual or artistic content of the
bibliographic item, which is more generically referred to as document A. 
Includes the more precise `translatedFrom`, `arrangementOf`,
`abridgementOf`, and `annotationOf`. (_hasExpression_)

translatedFrom::: document B is an Expression of document A in a
different language than the source Expression of A (translation).
This includes dubbed and subtitled versions of a film.
(_hasTranslation_)

arrangementOf::: document B is an arrangement Expression of document A.
The main document has the same intellectual or artistic content as the target document, and the main
document has been created to realise that content through different resources than the target document.
Is typically understood to involve the realisation of a musical work with different instruments or voices 
than the original. This includes adding parts or an accompaniment. (_hasArrangement_)

abridgementOf::: document B is an abridged Expression of document A.
The main document presents a subset of the intellectual or artistic content of the target document,
but is still intended as a complete work, presenting a shortened version of the source Expression of A.
(_hasAbridgement_)

annotationOf::: document B is an annotated Expression of document A.
The main document has a target document which incorporates part or all of it, and which
enhances it with explanatory commentary not present in the source
Expression of A (annotation). (_hasAnnotation_)

===== Revision relations

FRBR uses Revision to refer to the updating of the content of a
source Expression to form a new Expression, in ways that do not
involve changing language (translation), resources/instrumentation
(arrangement), or extent (abridgement, annotation). So a Revision
updates the content of an Expression, but is not a new Abridgement,
Translation, Arrangement, or Annotation; an Abridgement,
Translation, Arrangement, or Annotation can be based on a specific
Revision; and an Abridgement, Translation, Arrangement, or
Annotation can have multiple Revisions of their own.

Revision includes not only an author updating the content of their
own work, but a third party updating that content, often after the
author has deceased (indicated bibliographically as "Revised by") It
also includes a scholar reconstructing the author's text on the
basis of available evidence, including previous editions where
available (indicated bibliographically as "Edited by"; hence we can
distinguish Cox's, Edmond's, Lobel & Page's and Voigt's editions of
Sappho, all done in the 20th century). Annotation is most commonly
seen in the context of such scholarly editions, so `annotationOf`
should be reserved for cases where the Expression does not provide
its own version of the textual content of the Work it is annotating.
This is somewhat rare, and FRBR does not model annotations as
distinct from revisions.

draftOf:: document B is a specific unpublished or revision of document A;
it may also be the first, unpublished
expression of document A. Document A may be a Work or an Expression
(e.g. a draft may be specific to an edition or translation).
Document A need not itself be published. (_hasDraft_)

editionOf:: document B is a published revision of document A, or the
first published Expression of document A. Document A is a Work, or else document A is
an Expression with the same language, instrumentation, and
substantially the same extent as B (i.e. translations, arrangements,
abridgements, annotations can have editions; editions cannot have
editions). (_hasEdition_)

updates::: document B is an edition of the same Work as document A,
and is subsequent to document A; A is an Expression.
Unlike the `obsoletes` relation,
the target document may still remain valid after the main document appears.
(However by default in the standards world, it does not.) (_updatedBy_)

obsoletes::: document A supersedes document B, being applicable or
valid in more or newer domains than document B. (The two documents
are not necessarily Expressions of the same Work.) (_obsoletedBy_)

NOTE: Documents often have notions of corrections and other minor
adjustments to content, which are not modelled bibliographically as
distinct editions. This distinction or lack of distinction is
captured in Relaton through the `edition` element; the `hasEdition`
relation still applies to such minor variants of the text, whether
they are considered distinct editions or not.

==== Derived relations

In the following, the two related items belong to distinct works,
but the creation of document B is determined in some way by document A.

derivedFrom:: document A is derived from document B, depending on it
for at least some of its content; includes
classes not otherwise specified, such as parodies (_derives_)

describes::: document A is a description of document B.
Includes the more specific `catalogues` relation. (_describedBy_)

catalogues:::: document A is a catalogue including a description of
document B, expected to be a bibliographic record (_cataloguedBy_)

hasSuccessor::: document A is succeeded by document B in a sequence:
The main document has ceased fulfilling some function, and the target document has assumed that
function in its stead. Typically applies when the main document is a periodical publication
which has ceased publication, and the target document is a new periodical publication,
designated as the continuation of the main document (i.e. continuation of journal). (_successorOf_)

adaptedFrom::: document A is a reworking of document B to make it
suitable for a different audience
(FRBR Adaptation: includes paraphrase, free translation, musical variations) 
or medium (FRBR Transformation: includes dramatisation, novelisation, versification,
screenplay). In music, an adaptation changes the musical content, whereas an arrangement
changes the instrumenal and vocal resources of the work. (_hasAdaptation_)

adoptedFrom::: document A is adopted in response to document B:
The main document has its content derived from the target document, and has been adopted in response to it
by a distinct authorising body.  Typically it is a national standard body's counterpart to an international
standard. (These are potentially
the same content, but they have distinct institutional authorship and
application; this kind of appropriation of text is not
characteristic of literary works.) Includes more specific relations `identical`, `equivalent`,
and `nonequivalent`. (_adoptedAs_)

identical:::: document A is adopted from document B, is equivalent to it in force and scope,
and is identical to it in content.

equivalent:::: document A is adopted from document B, and is equivalent to it in force and scope,
but has not undergone significant textual change.

nonequivalent:::: document A is adopted from document B, but is not equivalent to it in force and scope.

reviewOf::: document A is a evaluation of document B. (_hasReview_)

commentaryOf::: document A is a commentary on document B, but does
not include substantial text from document B, unlike `annotationOf`,
and so cannot be read independently of document B.
(This distinction is a judgement call.) (_hasCommentary_)

The distinction between distinct works and expressions of the same
work is subtle, and can vary culturally. Its major consequence is
whether the creator of the derived work is considered a secondary
author, and the derived work is still attributed to the original
author (in which case it is an Expression), or a primary author,
supplanting the original author (in which case it is a new Work).
The differentiation made in FRBR (3.2.1) is:

____
For the purposes of this study variant texts incorporating revisions
or updates to an earlier text are viewed simply as expressions of
the same work (i.e., the variant texts are not viewed as separate
works). Similarly, abridgements or enlargements of an existing text,
or the addition of parts or an accompaniment to a musical
composition are considered to be different expressions of the same
work. Translations from one language to another, musical
transcriptions and arrangements, and dubbed or subtitled versions of
a film are also considered simply as different expressions of the
same original work.

By contrast, when the modification of a work involves a significant
degree of independent intellectual or artistic effort, the result is
viewed, for the purpose of this study, as a new work. Thus
paraphrases, rewritings, adaptations for children, parodies, musical
variations on a theme and free transcriptions of a musical
composition are considered to represent new works. Similarly,
adaptations of a work from one literary or art form to another
(e.g., dramatizations, adaptations from one medium of the graphic
arts to another, etc.) are considered to represent new works.
Abstracts, digests and summaries are also considered to represent
new works.
____

==== Other relations

related:: document A is related to document B in an otherwise
unspecified fashion.

complementOf:: document A is a complement or supplement of document B
(e.g. concordance, teacher's guide, gloss, addendum, appendix,
libretto, incidental music), and provides additional
or contextual information to help understand the document. (_hasComplement_).

cites:: document A references document B (_isCitedIn_)

==== Refinements 

The following relations are treated as refinements, and are
expressed in `bibitem/relation/description`, not `bibitem/relation/type`. The refinements a
relation type can undergo are open-ended, and this list may be
expanded in the future to encourage interoperability.

updates::

corrects::: document A updates document B, and the change does not
affect the intended meaning (_correctedBy_)

amends::: document A updates document B, and the change is a minor
change to the intended meaning (_amendedBy_)

revises::: document A updates document B, and the change is a major
change to the intended meaning (_revisedBy_)

reproductionOf::

facsimile::: document A is a reproduction of two-dimensional
document B (e.g. book, manuscript), which prioritises visual
accuracy

replica::: document A is a reproduction of three-dimensional or
pictorial document B (e.g. sculpture, oil painting), which
prioritises visual and tactile accuracy

NOTE: *Bolded* entries indicate non-identical matches where the
meaning of mapped values differ. Some may represent one-to-many or
partial matches.

=== Localities

The relation between two bibliographic items may not apply to either
the first ("source") item, or the second ("target") item, in their
entirety. For that reason, the relation may also specify one more
more localities in the target item (`localityStack`), and one or
more localities in the source item (`sourceLocalityStack`), as
constraining the relation.

For example, the following expresses that Chapter 3 of the first
edition of _Telescopy_ has been superseded by Chapters 4 and 7 of
the second edition.

  <title>Telescopy</title>

      </locality>
    </localityStack>
  </relation>
</bibitem>

[[host-item]]
=== Host item

Of the bibliographic types identified in <<bibtype>>,
`incollection`, `inproceedings`, and `inbook` are all inherently
related to a host item. Other types also potentially involve
relations with host items; for example, the relation between a
record track and a record, or a broadcast segment and a broadcast
show. The relation between host item and contained item is modelled
through `includedIn` or `partOf`, depending on whether all included
items share authorship or corporate authorship.

The relation between any two items optionally includes a locality
element, which indicates which part of the first item is related to
the second. (For example, which part of the first item is superseded
by the second.) The locality in the relation element can be used
with "includedIn" relations, to indicate the extent of the contained
item within the host item; but for consistency, it is preferable to
use the `extent` element in the contained item, which has the same
meaning.

The expected relations between host and contained items are as follows:

|===
|Host |Contained |Relation

|book, booklet, manual, techreport
|incollection (if has its own title—autonomous item)
|includedIn

|book, booklet, manual, techreport
|inbook (if it does not have its own title, e.g. numbered chapter, page span)
|partOf

|journal
|article
|includedIn

|proceedings, conference
|inproceedings
|includedIn

|thesis, standard, patent
|inbook
|partOf

|map
|map
|partOf (atlas) or includedIn (collection)

|electronic resource
|electronic resource
|partOf (multipart work) or includedIn (collection)

|broadcast
|broadcast (treated as same corporate author)
|partOf

|music
|music (typically involves same author)
|partOf

|graphic work
|graphic work
|partOf (multipart work) or includedIn (collection)

|film
|film (typically involves same author)
|partOf

|video
|video (typically involves same author)
|partOf

|===

In general: text-based resources have components that can be
considered a different kind of resource; components of non-textual
resources are considered to be of the same type as their host.

[[translation]]
=== Translation

Translations are items derived from an item in a different language.
Typically in bibliographies, the details of the source item are not
provided for a translation, outside of the original author, and
possibly the date of publication and the source language title of
the original title.

If the information about the source item is limited to these, no
relation need be invoked in the title:

* the source title can be modelled as an original title variant
(<<alt-title>>);

* the author differentiated from the translator as creators
(<<creator-selection>>); and

* the date of authorship differentiated from the date of translation
(<<date>>: `date[@type="created"]` vs `date[@type="adapted"]`).

However, if any further details of the source item need to be
provided (e.g.  source language: ISO 690, 4.11), they should
be modelled through an overt relationship between the source item
and the translation.
