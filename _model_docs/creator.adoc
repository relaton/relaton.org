== Creator

=== General

* Source: ISO 690, 4.1
* Serialisation: `bibitem/contributor`, `Person, Organization, Affiliation`

ISO 690, 4.1 classifies the various possible roles a creator can have
with regard to a resource into broad categories in order of priority,
with more refined classifications typically named for the creator.

These classifications are retained in the Relaton model:

`bibitem/contributor/role@type`::
Provides the broad category of role
(author, performer, compiler, adaptor, publisher, distributor),
with some further refinements to deal with the range of roles in other standards,
and roles whose status is intermediate between those categories (e.g. translator).
The content of this element is optional, and contains a more specific expression
of the creator role.

`bibitem/contributor/role/description`::
Contains one or more specific descriptions of the role of the contributor.
The description can be strictly a noun, e.g. "librettist", or it can be a
phrase, corresponding to how it will be rendered in a citation ("libretto by");
the choice is at the discretion of the bibliographer, and is determined by how
the citation is expected to be rendered (as rendering systems are unlikely to be
sophisticated enough to convert the one into the other.)


=== Role

The Relaton model further refines the ISO 690 model of roles, based on analysis
of the 270 creator roles encoded in the
https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/[MARC bibliographic standard].

The Relaton listing of roles is as follows:

`author`:: creates a Work (ISO 690: "a) creator of work")
+
--
Creator of the intellectual content of the bibliographic item. Includes both the major intellectual contributors to intellectual
content, and subsidiary contributors.

Includes: _composer, librettist, mapping agency, surveyor,
cartographer, system designer of software, patentee,
patent applicant, artist, photographer, draughtsman, graphic
designer, inventor._

In the case of documents arising from legal cases, all participants
involved are considered creators, e.g. _applicants, complainants, defendants,
judges_.
--

`editor`::: finalises a Work; "finalises" is a subclass of "creates" (ISO 690: "c) reviser of work")
+
--
Party imposing structure on the intellectual content of the bibliographic item.
Is someone finalising a work (i.e. its intellectual content), which has been
created or initiated by others.

Includes: _compiler, corrector, curator, editor, moderator, proofreader, reviser_.
--

`adapter`::: creates a Derived-Work, a Work derived from the initial Work ISO 690: "d) creator of derivative work")
+
--
Party converting the intellectual content of the bibliographic item into
a different medium or form.

Includes: _abridger, annotator, adapter, commentator, reviewer;
photographer of another creator's work, copyist, arranger_.
--

`realizer`:: creates an Expression of a Work (ISO 690: "b) expresser of created work")
+
--
Realises the intellectual content of the bibliographic item.
Contributes to the work being realised in a particular intellectual or
artistic form, but is distinct from a mass-produced physical presentation
of that form (a manifestation).

Includes: _animator, art director, film director, cinematographer, engineer,
music copyist, musical director, recordist, stage manager, videographer;
analyst, court reporter, markup editor, programmer, scribe_.

A large number of visual artists, such as engravers, etchers, and illustrators,
can be modelled as creators, realisers, or adapters, depending on whether
they are creating work they have conceived of themselves (_author_),
carrying out a creator's artistic vision and following their drafts (_realizer_),
or copying an artistic work that has already been fully realised in a different
medium (_adapter_). In the bibliographic description of visual works,
_realizer_ is the usual role involved.
--

`translator`::: creates an Expression of a Work in a novel language
+
--
Party converting the intellectual content of the bibliographic item into
a different language. Is given a separate role from _realizer_ because of the
prominence given to translators in bibliographic description.
--

`performer`::: creates an Expression as a novel performance (time-bound realisation of Work), specific to performing arts
+
--
Indicates the performers realising the work in a time-bound event. If performers are indicated for
an artistic work, a distinction is made between the performers ("front of stage"),
and the _realizers_, the other contributors working towards realising the performance
in a planning or coordinating role ("backstage").

Includes: _actor, conductor, dancer, musician, narrator, performer, singer_.
--

`publisher`:: creates a Manifestation of an Expression, a distinct presentation (ISO 690: "e) publisher of manifestation")
+
--
Party responsible for the bibliographic item becoming publicly available.
Covers all parties involved in creating and producing a manifestation
(physical presentation) of the work.

Includes: _bookbinder, manufacturer, online information provider, publisher,
printer, production company_.
--

`distributor`:: gives out Items of a Manifestation to an audience (ISO 690: "f) distributor of manifestation")
+
--
Party arranging for the bibliographic item to become publicly accessible.
Covers all parties involved in making a manifestation available, and
providing manifestation Items to owners.

Includes: _auctioneer, bookseller, online host, provider,
repository, vendor_.
--

`authorizer`::: authorises the Work, lends it authority
+
--
Party which lends its authority to the bibliographic item, and vouches for its
quality and accuracy.
Covers most cases of corporate authorship: the organisation lends its
authority to works that individual authors create, whether as work for hire,
or under the auspices of the organisation.

Includes: _copyright holder, degree supervisor, issuing body, jurisdiction,
laboratory, licensor, monitor, scholarly society, scientific advisor, software company,
standards body_.
--

`enabler`::: supports, enables, facilitates a Work, an Expression, or a Manifestation. (This includes funders, sponsors.)
+
--
Party who is involved in supporting, enabling, or facilitating the
production of a bibliographic item, without contributing directly to its
intellectual content, realisation, or presentation.

Includes: _donor, host institution, licensee, patron, producer, sponsor_.
--

`owner`:: receives Items of a Manifestation
+
--
Party who is in physical possession of a bibliographic item.

Includes: _autographer, collector, depositor, lender, owner_.
--


`subject`:: referenced in a Work.
+
--
Party who is referenced in a bibliographic item. Is not properly a contributor of
intellectual content, but is included because of edge cases in some contributor
models.

Includes: _addressee, cited, dedicatee, depicted, honoree, subject_.
--

[NOTE]
--
The above description uses the older FRBR distinction between:

* Works (a family of content identified as the same),
* Expressions (versions of the content of a Work, including revisions and performers),
* Manifestations (presentations of an Expression),
* Items (instances of a Manifestation).

Later bibliographic models such as BIBFRAME conflate Expressions and
Manifestations, as the distinction can be difficult to make, but it is useful in
defining publishers abstractly.

[[creator-selection]]
=== Selection

Whether subsidiary creators should be included in a bibliographic item, and
which creators should be included, is at the discretion of the bibliographer.

Exceptionally, "translator" is differentiated from the other "adaptor" roles,
because it is so different from other adaptor roles such
as "engraver" or "photographer".


=== Derivative works

For derivative works, the creator and title of the original resource can be
mentioned as a bibliographic note (`bibitem/note`).
However, best practice is to treat the original resource as a distinct related
bibliographic item, related through the
`derivedFrom` relation (See link:/model/relations[Document Relations]).

Likewise, different originators of different editions should be modelled by
modelling the editions as distinct related items, each with its own distinct
editor as contributor. (For example, the later edition given as the main item,
and the earlier edition related through a "updatedBy" relation.)

NOTE: Although both "composer" and "librettist" are included as authors under
ISO 690, 4.1,
the two roles are clearly differentiated in ISO 690, 5.7, with the
"composer" given priority over the "librettist".

NOTE: Inventor and patentee are atypical of the "performer" roles,
and could arguably be regarded as author roles instead.

=== Sponsoring organisations

Sponsoring organisations are conventionally included as distributors,
following practice in ISO 690.

Note that in this model, sponsors are no longer conflated with distributors, and SDOs are differentiated from publishers;
they are often but not always the same organisation in the case of standards.

=== Personal names

Names may be modelled either broken up into their constituent components
(prefix, forename, initials, surname, addition), or as a complete name string.
The latter is useful if
(contrary to the recommendation of ISO 690, 4.1)
language-specific conventions for ordering of name components are to be
observed; e.g. "`James CLARK, John COWAN, MURATA Makoto`".

If there are multiple contributors named in a role, all contributors are
expected to be represented in the bibliographic entry.
This reflects practice in electronic bibliographic tools, and renderers
may choose to truncate contributors with "`et al.`" beyond a certain cutoff point.
If this information is not available, a dummy contributor can be
named with "`et al.`" as their `completename`, but this is not preferred.

The `formatted-initials` component is used if all forenames are replaced by initials.
If only the middle name is replaced by an initial, it is still treated as a
forename.

Forenames are given an `initial` attribute if initials are to be assembled on a more granular basis.

[[organisation]]
=== Organisations

The model caters for both full names and abbreviations of organisations.
Subordinate body names are modelled separately from the parent body name; the
choice of whether
to model parent + subordinate or a single name depends on the degree of
independence of the subordinate body, as outlined in ISO 690, 4.1.

[[variantnames]]
=== Pseudonyms and Variant Names

Variant names, and assumed names, can both be modelled
as notes on names. However, for greater clarity, and for modelling
of the internal structure of the variant or assumed name,
a variant name can be modelled, with the same level of detail
as default names. The type of variant, or relation between the name
and variant, needs to be made explicit in that case.
For example `pseudonym`/`pseudonymOf` for literary pseudonyms,
or `username`/`usernameOf` for social media usernames.

Variant names can be applied to personal names,
organization names, and organization subdivision names.

=== Anonymous and Varii

Descriptors of authors, such as "`Anon`" or
"`Various Authors`", should be given as `completename`
elements. The model does not standardise the designations of
authors. As with pseudonyms, the real name of the creator if known can be
modelled as a note, or as a name variant.
