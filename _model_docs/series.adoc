[[series]]
== Series title and number

=== General

* Source: ISO 690, 4.8, ISO 690, 5.2
* Serialisation: `bibitem/series`


=== Journals

Articles have their journal title modelled as the series title of the article item.
However, the journal volume and issue should be modelled as part of the article
item extent (link:/model/numeration[Numeration]), rather than as part of the series (ISO 690, 4.7).

=== Standards

Standards body identifiers for standards (ISO 690, 5.9) are modelled as series numbers.

=== Archival materials

The collection or fonds of archival material is modelled as a series.

=== Qualifiers

Organization and Place of Publication can be added to series titles for disambiguation.
Organization in this instance is only modelled as a strings, rather than as a detailed
object (cf. link:/model/creator#organisation[Organisation]). The `formattedTitle` element is used to enforce the formatting
of the series title and its qualifiers.

=== Earlier and later titles

The current title of a series is given with `series@type` as "main" (which is the default);
alternate titles, including
historical titles, are given with `series@type` as "alt". Different time spans for historical
titles are given with `series/dateFrom` and `series/dateTo`.

=== Series runs

If a series restarts numbering its volumes, that is typically indicated in citations
by giving an ordinal number for the series run, given after the series name:
1st series, 2nd series, 3rd series.
More commonly, there are only two series runs for a series, and the second run is
indicated as "`new series`", or the abbreviation "`n.s.`".

*  _Vizantiiskii Vremmenik_ (St Petersburg/Petrograd/Leningrad, 1894-1928) and
_Vizantiiskii Vremmenik_ (Moscow, 1947-) have the same name, and volume numbering
for the Moscow journal restarted at 1; the first two
volumes of the new series run were numbered 1/26 and 2/27, to continue the first series.
While citations could differentiate the two by city, usual practice is to insert
"`n.s.`" after the journal title for the second series.

* The _Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute_ was originally published
as _Man_, from 1901-1965. The journal restarted numbering at 1 from 1966-1996
without changing name, and explicitly designating itself as a "`new series`".
Unlike _Vizantiiskii Vremmenik_, both series were published in London, so
place of publication cannot differentiate between them. While the organization did
change name between the two runs (from "`Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland`" to
"`Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland`"), the change is slight;
and the series run is preferred to differentiate the two runs.
