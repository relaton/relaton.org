== Introduction

=== The International Standard Book Number (ISBN)

The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is the ubiquitous identifier used
to uniquely identify books and other monographic publications. It provides a
standardized way to reference and catalog books, making it easier to manage and
track publications across the publishing industry.

Since its launch in 1972, the ISBN has been an essential part of the
publishing industry, providing a unique identifier for books and other
monographic publications. Initially a 10-digit number, it was expanded to 13
digits in 2005.

ISBNs are essential for the book trade, libraries, and bibliographic services.
They provide a unique identifier for each edition and format of a book,
simplifying inventory management, sales tracking, and cataloging processes.

Each ISBN uniquely identifies a specific edition and format of a book, making it
invaluable for inventory management, sales tracking, and bibliographic
record-keeping.

The purpose of this International Standard is to coordinate and standardize the
use of book numbers internationally. An International Standard Book Number
(ISBN) identifies one title, or edition of a title, from one specific publisher,
ensuring it is unique to that title or edition.


=== A brief history of ISBN

ISBN is an adoption of the British Standard Book Numbering (SBN) system, a
9-digit system originally developed by the bookseller WHSmith. The SBN system
was first introduced in the United Kingdom in 1967, then adopted and extended by
ISO/TC 46 for the international community.

The initial ISBN standard was approved in September 1971 by ISO members
and published the year after, as *ISO 2108:1972*.

|===

The standard was later revised as:

* https://www.iso.org/standard/6897.html[ISO 2108:1978] (2nd edition);
* https://www.iso.org/standard/6898.html[ISO 2108:1992] (3rd edition);
* https://www.iso.org/standard/36563.html[ISO 2108:2005] (4th edition);
* https://www.iso.org/standard/65483.html[ISO 2108:2017] (5th edition).

In 2005, the number of digits was increased to 13. In the words of the standard,
this was done to "increase substantially the numbering capacity of the global
ISBN system and to harmonise the format of the ISBN with the EAN-UCC product
code system."

Therefore there are currently 2 types of ISBN codes:

* ISBN with 10-digits, now commonly referred as "ISBN-10";
* ISBN with 13-digits, now commonly referred as "ISBN-13".


=== The ISBN system

The ISBN system is managed by the
https://www.isbn-international.org[International ISBN Agency]. The agency is
appointed as the Registration Authority for this ISO standard to coordinate and
supervise worldwide use of the ISBN system.

The International ISBN Agency plays a crucial role in the global book industry
by registering additional National ISBN agencies. These national agencies, in
turn, facilitate the registration of books within their respective countries or
regions, ensuring a standardized system for book identification worldwide.



=== Structure of the ISBN code

This is best described by the original ISO 2108:1972 standard:

____
When an international standard book number is either written or printed it shall
be preceded by the letters ISBN, and each part shall be separated by a space or
a hyphen as in the following examples:

* ISBN 0 571 08989 5

* ISBN 90-7000-234-5
____

NOTE: These digits are the arabic numerals 0 to 9; in the case of the check
digit only, an X can sometimes occur.

An ISBN (ISBN 10 code) consists of ten digits made up of the following parts:

group identifier:: The group number is assigned by the International ISBN Agency
for a group of publishers.
(i.e. national, geographical, language or other convenient group)
"It will vary in length from group to group according to the title output of the
group concerned." (ISO 2108:1972, 2.1)

publisher identifier::
"The publisher identifier will be allocated internally within the group, by the
agency appointed for this purpose. It will vary in length from publisher to
publisher according to the title output of the publisher concerned."
(ISO 2108:1972, 2.2)

title identifier::
"The length of the title identifier will be determined by the length of the
group and publisher identifiers which precede it."
(ISO 2108:1972, 2.3)

check digit::
"The check digit is calculated on a modulus 11 with weights 10-2, using X in
lieu of 10 where 10 would occur as a check digit."
(ISO 2108:1972, 2.4)


The title identifier is the only part of the ISBN that is variable in length,
depending on the length of the group and publisher identifiers.

The assigners of identifiers are as follows:

* The group identifier is assigned by the International ISBN Agency.
* The publisher identifier is assigned by the regional ISBN agency.
* The title identifier is assigned by the publisher.

The 13-digit ISBN is made up of the same parts except that the group identifier
can be longer. The check digit is calculated differently, and the ISBN-13 is the
same as the EAN-13 barcode.


=== OpenLibrary: A Digital Library Initiative

https://openlibrary.org[OpenLibrary] is a project of the
https://archive.org[Internet Archive], aiming to create "one web page for every
book ever published."

The International ISBN Agency is only concerned with assigning group identifiers,
and does not keep a global database of ISBNs. There are various commercial
databases that provide ISBN lookup services, but these are all proprietary and
are only accessible behind paywalls.

OpenLibrary, on the other hand, is an open, editable library catalog that
provides free access to millions of book records, including many full-text
books.

OpenLibrary maintains a vast database of bibliographic information, indexed by
ISBN among other identifiers, and provides an open API for retrieval of
bibliographic information. This makes it an excellent resource for retrieving
book metadata programmatically.

NOTE: Keep in mind that OpenLibrary is a community-driven project. While it
already provides millions of ISBN records, it does not contain the full set
of metadata of all books and monographs issued with an ISBN identifier.
We encourage anyone who discovers missing or incorrect data to contribute to
the OpenLibrary project by adding or correcting the metadata.

=== Difference between OpenLibrary and Crossref

https://crossref.org[Crossref] is a paywalled "for-profit service" run by a
non-profit organization,
which provides a slow bibliographic endpoint to encourage users to pay for their
faster API.

On the other hand, OpenLibrary is completely open and free, with an excellent
data API that is not limited or restricted.

We commend the OpenLibrary for democratizing bibliographic information access,
and would strongly recommend usage of and contribution to the OpenLibrary over
Crossref.

We find that bibliographic information from OpenLibrary often
exceeds in quality with compared to the same from Crossref.

* This stems from the fact that OpenLibrary is a community-driven project, and
the data is often curated by volunteers who are passionate about books and
libraries.

* Crossref on the other hand takes whatever publishers dump into it, and often
the metadata is incomplete or incorrect.


=== Relaton and ISBN Support

Relaton, an interoperable data model for citations based on ISO 690, has now
expanded its capabilities to include ISBN lookup through OpenLibrary. This
integration allows users to easily retrieve bibliographic information for books
using their ISBN.

The new functionality is implemented in the
https://github.com/relaton/relaton-isbn[relaton-isbn] gem. This addition to
the Relaton ecosystem further enhances its ability to provide comprehensive
bibliographic data across various identification systems.

Relaton supports retrieval of both ISBN-10 and ISBN-13 from OpenLibrary.


== Using Relaton for ISBN Lookups

=== Installation and setup

To use Relaton's ISBN lookup functionality, you'll need to install the Relaton
CLI.

This can be done using the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ gem install relaton-cli
----

=== Fetching bibliographic data

Once installed, you can use the Relaton CLI to fetch bibliographic data for
books using their ISBN.

[source,console]
----
$ relaton fetch isbn:{ISBN}
----

This will return the bibliographic record in Relaton XML format by default. You
can specify other output formats using the `-f` flag, such as YAML or BibTeX.

=== Example: Looking up "Snow Crash"

We use Neal Stephenson's seminal cyberpunk novel "Snow Crash" as an example.
This book, first published in 1992, is often credited with popularizing the
concept of the Metaverse.

The ISBN-13 for a popular paperback edition of "Snow Crash" is 978-0553380958.

Here's how we can fetch its bibliographic data using Relaton:

[source,console]
----
$ relaton fetch isbn:9780553380958 -f yaml
----

This command will return the bibliographic information in YAML format.

Here's what the output might look like:

[source,yaml]
----
---
schema-version: v1.2.9
id: '9780553380958'
title:
- content: Snow crash
  format: text/plain
  type: main
link:
- content: http://openlibrary.org/books/OL18141225M/Snow_crash
  type: src
docid:
- id: '9780553380958'
  type: ISBN
  primary: true
date:
- type: published
  value: '2000'
contributor:
- person:
    name:
      completename:
        content: Neal Stephenson
  role:
  - type: author
- person:
    name:
      completename:
        content: Juanma Barranquero
  role:
  - type: author
- organization:
    name:
    - content: Bantam Books
  role:
  - type: publisher
revdate: '2000'
place:
- city: New York
----

This YAML output provides a wealth of information about the book, including its
title, author, publisher, publication date, and more. All of this data is
structured according to the Relaton bibliographic data model, making it easy to
integrate with other Relaton-compatible systems.



== Beyond basic lookups

While simple ISBN lookups are straightforward, Relaton's capabilities extend
beyond this.

=== Batch processing

You can create scripts to process multiple ISBNs in batch. For example:

.bash script using Relaton to fetch OpenLibrary data using ISBNs into a BibTeX file
[source,sh]
----
#!/bin/bash
ISBNs="9780553380958 9780307887436 9780062190376"
echo "" > sci_fi_books.bibtex
for isbn in $ISBNs; do
  relaton fetch isbn:$isbn -f bibtex >> sci_fi_books.bibtex
done
----

This script would create a BibTeX file containing entries for "Snow Crash" and two other science fiction novels.

=== Integration with Ruby Code

For developers working within the Ruby ecosystem, the `relaton-isbn` gem can be used directly in Ruby code:

.Ruby code that fetches Relaton bibliographic objects using ISBN identifiers
[source,ruby]
----
require 'relaton_isbn'

isbn = "9780553380958"
item = RelatonIsbn::IsbnBibliography.get("isbn:#{isbn}")
puts item.to_yaml
----

This allows for more complex processing and integration with other Ruby-based
systems.



== Enhancements and caveats

=== Challenges with OpenLibrary data

OpenLibrary is a valuable resource for bibliographic information, offering a
vast collection of book data that is openly accessible. It provides unique
identifiers for books and aims to create "one web page for every book ever
published."

However, using OpenLibrary data comes with its own set of challenges:

* Data quality varies significantly across entries;
* Metadata is not consistently normalized;
* Book information can be incomplete or outdated;
* Duplicate entries for the same book are common;
* User-contributed data may introduce errors.

These issues arise from OpenLibrary's collaborative nature, where data is
contributed by various users and sources without rigorous standardization.

We recommend using OpenLibrary as a starting point for gathering book
information, but users should be prepared to verify and supplement the data from
other sources.

== Specific examples of OpenLibrary data challenges

=== Conflicted entries on a unique ISBN number

Given that the OpenLibrary is contributor focused, there are occasionally
issues with conflicting entries for the same ISBN.

.Different Snow Crash entries with the same ISBN
[example]
====
The ISBN-10 `0553380958` for "Snow Crash" links to two entries:

[cols="a,a",options="header"]
|===
h| https://openlibrary.org/books/OL18141225M/Snow_crash[Entry 1]: Bantam trade reissue, May 2000
h| https://openlibrary.org/books/OL23230597M/Snow_crash[Entry 2]: Bantam Spectra trade paperback reissue/September 2008

|
image::/assets/blog/2024-01-19/snow-crash-2.png[]

|===

====

This can lead to confusion when trying to retrieve accurate bibliographic data.


=== Conflated author names

Some author names are actually combinations of multiple names.

.Author names not properly normalized
[example]
====
This entry for
https://openlibrary.org/works/OL31707543W/Beowulf_and_the_Finnesburg_Fragment[Beowulf and the Finnesburg Fragment]
lists a single author as "John R. Clark; Wrenn, C. L.; Tolkien, J. R. R. Hall".

However, this single author entry contains 3 creators's names rolled into one.
====


=== Incomplete publication information

Some entries lack complete publication details, such as:

* Missing publisher
* Incomplete publication date (only year, no month or day)
* Missing publication place
* Incomplete edition information

For these entries, when you notice any missing or incorrect bibliographic data,
we encourage you to directly contribute to OpenLibrary to improve the quality of
the data.

At least you have a direct avenue to fix the item for your usage and benefit
others who may encounter the same issue!


=== Duplicate entries

OpenLibrary often has multiple entries for the same book, especially for works
with many editions.

These duplicates may contain conflicting information. For example, "1984" by
George Orwell might have several entries with different publication years,
ISBNs, and even slight variations in the title.


=== Missing or incorrect cover images

While OpenLibrary aims to provide cover images, many entries lack them or have
incorrect images associated.

That said, if you are concerned only about bibliographic citations, then this
isn't a problem.



== Working with OpenLibrary data

Despite these challenges, OpenLibrary remains a valuable resource.

To make the most of it:

. Double-check the rendered bibliographic information to ensure completeness of
data;
. Be prepared to fill in gaps in information manually (if you use Metanorma, use
citation spans);
. Contribute corrections back to OpenLibrary when errors are found;

By understanding these limitations and taking appropriate measures, you can
effectively utilize the ISBN fetch functionality from OpenLibrary's extensive
publications database.


== Conclusion

The addition of ISBN support to Relaton through OpenLibrary integration
represents a significant enhancement to the Relaton ecosystem. It provides
researchers, librarians, and developers with a powerful tool for retrieving
standardized bibliographic data for books.

We encourage users to explore this new functionality, contribute to its
development, and provide feedback to help improve this valuable resource for the
broader community of bibliographic data users.
